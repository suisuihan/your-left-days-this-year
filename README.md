# your-left-days-this-year
create one screen protect picture that include how many days left this year

## Enveriment
python: 3.7

## Dependencies
use Pillow lib to draw picture, so you need to:
~~~shell
pip install Pillow
~~~

## Maybe you want to do ... and just do it:
* change fuction ScreenPicture.create_picture parameters when your screen is not 2560 * 1600
* change var picture_dir to define your picture path
* change font
* change what to disploy

## Todo(or never):
* I don't know any knowledge about colors, so I pick some RGB info from (clickthis)[http://b.xiumi.us/board/v5/251mJ/23381856], it is a bad method but it works…… Hope for your suggestion
* It does not compare the color of content you want to disploy with background, so sometime it looks ugly
